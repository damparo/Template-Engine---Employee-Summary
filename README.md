# Template-Engine---Employee-Summary

## Assignment Goal

The goal of this assignment was to create command line application that would generate a work team consisting of a manager, engineer, and intern.
The app would prompt the user with various questions to build the team member profiles and afterwards would open an html page with the assembled team.

## Functionality

The application operates out of the command terminal using node and takes in user information to build a team.  An html page is then generated displaying team information

## Thoughts:

I want to come back to this application and add the code for testing.
